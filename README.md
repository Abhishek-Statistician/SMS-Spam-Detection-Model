# SMS-Spam-Detection-Model
AICTE Internship on AI: Transformative Learning with TechSaksham

Developed an efficient SMS spam classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP), leading to significant improvements in data accuracy.

Technologies Used:
ðŸ”¹ Python | Scikit-learn | Pandas | NumPy | Streamlit

Key Features:
âœ” Data Cleaning & Preprocessing â€“ Removed unnecessary columns and duplicate entries, assigned labels (0 for non-spam, 1 for spam), converted text to lowercase, and applied tokenization.

âœ” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Separated characters, words, and sentences, computed statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, quartiles, and correlation, and visualized insights using pie charts, bar graphs, heatmaps, and word clouds.

âœ” Model Development & Evaluation â€“ Implemented multiple classification models, including various NaÃ¯ve Bayes algorithms, and assessed their accuracy and precision to select the best-performing model.

âœ” Web Deployment â€“ Deployed the trained model using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the classification system seamlessly.
